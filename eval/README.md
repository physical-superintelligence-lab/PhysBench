# Evaluation Guidelines

### Clone this scripts

```shell
git clone https://github.com/physical-superintelligence-lab/PhysBench
```

### Download the dataset

To download the data from the [🤗 Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/USC-GVL/PhysBench), you can prepare the dataset by executing the following command.

It is recommended to set `<your_path_for_dataset>` as `eval/physbench`; however, you may change this to a different path if necessary, in which case you must adjust the `--dataset_path` parameter accordingly.

```shell
cd <your_path_for_dataset>  # such as '/home/usr/dataset'
huggingface-cli download USC-GVL/PhysBench --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False --repo-type dataset
# Unzip the compressed files of videos and pictures
yes | unzip image.zip -d image
yes | unzip video.zip -d video
```

### Prepare Environment

To avoid conflicts caused by the specific library dependencies of the **video-llava** and **chat-univi** models, which may interfere with other models, we created a separate Conda environment. If you do not intend to test these two models, this step can be disregarded. All other operations are performed within the **physbench** environment.

```shell
# main environment (recommended)
conda create --name physbench python=3.10
conda activate physbench
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create a special environment for video-llava and chat-univi (selective)
conda create --name physbench_video python=3.10
conda activate physbench_video
pip install -r requirements-video.txt
```

### (Selective) Prepare 74 VLMs

Specifically, we have implemented 74 models within the `models` directory, which can be installed in a single step using the method outlined below.

- **Closed-Source Models**: To integrate closed-source models (such as `GPT`, `Gemini`, and `Claude`), you will need to configure your 🔑 API key in the file `eval/models/qa_model/imageqa_model.py`.
- **Open-Source Models**: All open-source models can be automatically downloaded via Hugging Face. You can refer to `eval/models/qa_model/imageqa_model.py` to identify the relevant keys. For example, the key "Mantis-llava-7b" will invoke the "Mantis" model class, which will automatically download the model from the Hugging Face repository "TIGER-Lab/Mantis-llava-7b".

    ```python
    "Mantis-llava-7b"                      : ("Mantis", 		 "TIGER-Lab/Mantis-llava-7b"),
    ```

### Test for You Model

##### Step 1

To adapt your model, you can refer to our implementation of 39 models within the `eval/models/qa_model/imageqa_model.py` file. You may create your own class, which should primarily include the methods `__init__` and `qa`, ensuring that both methods conform to the specified interfaces.

```shell
class YourModel(QAModelInstance):
	def __init__(self, ckpt, torch_device=torch.device("cuda"), model_precision=torch.float16, num_video_frames=8):
		### load your model
		self.model = ...
		self.tokenizer = ...
	def qa(self, image, prompt, mode):
		### give answer for each item
        output_ids = self.model.generate(
            input_ids,
            images=[images_tensor],
            do_sample=False,
            temperature=0.1,
            top_p=None,
            ... # other your config
        )
		outputs = self.tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
		answer = ...
		return answer # return the answer
```

Once implemented, you can add your model to the `imageqa_models` section at the top of the file, following the format below:

| model name                | class          | checkpoint path                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "instructblip-flan-t5-xl" | "InstructBlip" | "./eval/models/checkpoints/instructblip-flan-t5-xl" |

For video-based models, you may refer to `eval/models/qa_model/videoqa_model.py`.

##### Step 2

You will need to take the following steps:

- Add your `model_name` to the `task_split` section in the file located at `eval/eval_utils/task_evaluator.py`.

  `task_split` 中 `"instructblip-flan-t5-xl"        : "image-only"`,`

  For each model value, there are 3 options: `image-only` means only one image is input, `image&video` means only one video is input (actually the test is image-only + image&video), and `general` means interleaved data (actually the test is image-only + image&video + general)

- In the `PhysionBenchEvaluator` class, modify the `test` method to invoke the `prompt` interface of your model.

After completing these changes, you can execute your model using the provided script!

### Run the evaluation script

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=9 PYTHONPATH='./' python eval/test_benchmark.py --model_name gpt4o --dataset_path ./eval/physbench
```

After running the script, a file named `[model_name].json` will be generated in the `./eval/physbench/results` directory.
- [Common Case] We also provide a 📃[tested sample file](https://github.com/USC-GVL/PhysBench/tree/main/eval/physbench/test_case.json), which can be referenced to understand the required JSON submission format. 

- [For model only support one image input] If the model you are testing is a model like LLaVA-1.5 that only supports one image input, you need to select `image&video` instead of the `general` above. At this time, you are actually testing the results of removing interleaved items, which is the experiment in the main table in our paper. We also provide 📃[tested sample file w/o interleaved](https://github.com/USC-GVL/PhysBench/tree/main/eval/physbench/test_case.json). Please select **Dev Phase in [🔗 EvalAI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2461/overview)**

    > (You need to pay special attention to that for models like LLaVA-1.5 that only support one image input, you need to stitch multiple frames of the item with mode `image&video` (only one video input) into one frame for input. We do not support the evaluation of image-only models due to the problem of the EvalAI platform

### Print the Test Score

Given that EvalAI is too cumbersome, you can now directly use the following script to evaluate and print out the scores without uploading to the EvalAI platform! (The results below are consistent with those in EvalAI)

```shell
PYTHONPATH='./' python eval/print_test_score.py --test-file '[model_name].json'
```

- This script differs slightly from directly using function calls within `val`. To maintain consistency with EvalAI, it does not directly call...

~~Please upload this file to [🔗 EvalAI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2461/overview) to automatically evaluate the results. Please select **Test Phase in [🔗 EvalAI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2461/overview)**~~

### Some  cases

In `case` floder, you can find how to use `eval_utils` get the results.
